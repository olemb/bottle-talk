Bottle Talk
===========

This is my short talk on Bottle which I've given twice at the
University of Tromsø.


Creating Your Own Presentation
------------------------------

I've included the simple slide show library I wrote for this talk. If
you want to make your own presentation you can just modify
`slides.rst` and type `make`. This will give you `index.html`, which
means you can put this directory on a server or a memory stick and
open it in a browser.

The slides are written in `reStructuredText
<http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_ format.

The presentation should work with all recent browsers. (Tested with
Firefox, Chrome and Safari.) Touch devices will show all slides on one
page.
